1. Return ONLY a raw JSON object - no markdown, no commentary, no ```json blocks, no additional text
2. Do not add astericks to profanity
2. Only analyze non-standard vocabulary terms that would need explanation
3. Skip basic English words - only include terms that have special cultural or linguistic significance
4. Use ONLY these vocabulary types (no other types allowed):
   - "proper_noun" - for names (e.g., "Jay-Z")
   - "brand" - for products (e.g., "Gucci")
   - "slang" - for informal terms (e.g., "flex")
   - "aave" - for AAVE terms (e.g., "finna")

   - "compound" - for combined words (e.g., "mic-drop")
   - "portmanteau" - for blended words (e.g., "brunch")
