1. Return ONLY a raw JSON object - no markdown, no commentary, no ```json blocks, no additional text
2. Do not add asterisks to profanity
3. Only analyze individual non-standard vocabulary words that need explanation
4. Skip ALL of these types of words:
   - Basic English words (e.g., hands, ceiling, feeling)
   - Common contractions (e.g., don't, won't, I'm)
   - Standard English adjectives (e.g., provocative, fair)
   - Common verbs and verb phrases (e.g., get, going, pull up)
   - Basic nouns even if used non-standardly (e.g., hands is, bathroom)
   - Common emotional/mental state words (e.g., feeling, thinking)
   - Multi-word phrases unless they're established compound terms

5. ONLY include these types of vocabulary:
   - "proper_noun" - for a name (e.g., "Jay-Z")
   - "brand" - for a product (e.g., "Gucci", "Yeezys")
   - "slang" - for an informal word (e.g., "whip", "cap")
   - "aave" - for an AAVE word (e.g., "finna")
   - "vernacular" - for a dialect word (e.g., "ting")
   - "colloquialism" - for an informal word (e.g., "gonna")
   - "acronym" - for an abbreviated word (e.g., "GOAT")
   - "compound" - for a combined word (e.g., "mic-drop")
   - "portmanteau" - for a blended word (e.g., "brunch")
   - "neologism" - for a new word (e.g., "staycation")

The response must be this exact JSON structure with no wrapping:
