## Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup

1. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

2. The pre-commit hooks will:
- Format code with ruff
- Lint code with ruff
- Run type checks with mypy
- Keep dependencies up to date with uv

### Before Pushing to GitHub

Run the full test suite:
```bash
./scripts/test_ci.sh
```

This script:
- Creates a fresh virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Runs comprehensive tests
- Matches the GitHub CI environment

### Code Quality Checks

Pre-commit handles quick checks:
```bash
# Automatic on commit, or run manually:
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Full CI checks:
```bash
./scripts/test_ci.sh
```

### Best Practices

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Use uv for dependency management
   - Keep requirements.txt up to date
   - Run full test suite after dependency changes

2. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for new features
   - Mock external API calls
   - Use temporary directories for file operations

3. **Code Style**:
   - Follow ruff formatting
   - Add type hints
   - Keep functions focused and small
