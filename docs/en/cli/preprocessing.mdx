Matches song lyrics with their corresponding Genius annotations.

```bash
python -m src.scripts.preprocess_song --song "Follow God" --artist "Kanye West"
# OR
python -m src.scripts.preprocess_song --song-id 123
```
To run just vocab step:
python -m src.scripts.run_pipeline run-pipeline --artist 'kanye west' --song 'otis' --steps analyze

## Process

1. Takes the lyrics from `lyrics.json` and annotations from `annotations_cleaned.json`
2. Attempts to match lyrics and annotations in three ways:
   - Exact matches
   - Finding annotation fragments within lyrics
   - Finding lyrics within annotation fragments
3. Generates deterministic unique line IDs
4. Outputs matched lyrics and annotations to `lyrics_with_annotations.json`
