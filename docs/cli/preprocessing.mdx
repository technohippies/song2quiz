Matches song lyrics with their corresponding Genius annotations.

```bash
python -m src.scripts.preprocess_song --song "Jesus Is King" --artist "Kanye West"
# OR
python -m src.scripts.preprocess_song --song-id 123
```

## Process

1. Takes the lyrics from `lyrics.json` and annotations from `annotations_cleaned.json`
2. Attempts to match lyrics and annotations in three ways:
   - Exact matches
   - Finding annotation fragments within lyrics
   - Finding lyrics within annotation fragments
3. Outputs matched lyrics and annotations to `lyrics_with_annotations.json`
