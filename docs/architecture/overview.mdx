# Architecture Overview

Song2Quiz is organized into several key components, each with a specific responsibility in the exercise generation pipeline.

## Core Components

### Flow Orchestration (`src/flows/`)

Prefect workflow definitions that orchestrate the various tasks:

- `exercises/` - Exercise generation workflows
- `ingestion/` - Song data fetching and storage
- `preprocessing/` - Data cleaning and preparation

### Data Models (`src/models/`)

Type definitions and schema validation:

- `api/` - External API response models
- `exercises/` - Exercise type definitions
- `lyrics_analysis/` - Lyrics processing models

### External Services (`src/services/`)

API clients and external integrations:

- `genius.py` - Genius API client
- `lrclib.py` - LRCLib API client
- `openrouter.py` - OpenRouter API client

### Core Logic (`src/tasks/`)

Business logic implementations:

- `exercises/` - Exercise generation algorithms
- `lyrics_analysis/` - Lyrics processing logic
- `preprocessing/` - Data cleaning implementations

### Utilities (`src/utils/`)

Shared helper functions:

- `cleaning/` - Text cleaning utilities
- `io/` - File and path operations

### Test Suite (`tests/`)

Mirrors the `src` directory structure:

- `flows/` - Flow integration tests
- `scripts/` - CLI command tests
- `tasks/` - Unit tests for core logic

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**
   - CLI command triggers ingestion flow
   - Genius API client fetches data
   - Raw data stored in song directory

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize text
   - Process annotations
   - Align lyrics with annotations

3. **Exercise Generation**
   - Analyze processed data
   - Generate exercise variants
   - Format for presentation
